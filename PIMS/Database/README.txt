I'm not sure if this will work, but you can try doing the following commands and see if you can connect to the database. 
It worked for me, but I'm local since the server is on my computer. It might not work for another computer. 

In MVS click on Tools > connect to Database > select Microsoft SQL Server > OK

Server Name: INA-PC

Use the Windows Authentication and not the SQL Server Authentication

Database name: PIMS_Backend

and then click okay. 

The database should show up on the left, and  you can see the tables. 
I'm not sure where to go from here, may have to do some research.
